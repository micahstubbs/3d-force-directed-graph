3-dimensional representation of a force-directed iterative layout, using [3d-force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph). This wrapper component uses [ThreeJS](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)/WebGL for rendering and [ngraph](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.forcelayout3d) for the 3D physics engine.
